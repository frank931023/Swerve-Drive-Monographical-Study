# Swerve Drive Monographical Study

## About
A monographical study about FRC swerve drive made by three grade 11 students from Mingdao High School, respectively Benliu, AuthurLai, and frank931023.

## Assignments
Benliu : robotic power distribution and machine building

AuthurLai : robotic design and machine building

frank931023 : robotic programming and driving test

## Abstract

The purpose of this study is to implement an automatic storage robot. After understanding the different chassis of robots, it was found that the Swerve Drive chassis has the most advantageous mobility. After comparing different types of Swerve Drive, we chose to use Distributed for research. Initially, we ordered four sets of gearboxes from abroad, but only one set arrived due to time constraints. Therefore, we had to install it in the middle and conduct testing. Finally, we paired it with a conveyor belt that can move up and down to complete an automatic storage robot.
